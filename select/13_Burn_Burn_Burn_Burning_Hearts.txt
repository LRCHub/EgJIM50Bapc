I'm covered with flames, my skin is on fire but I won't burn burn burn burn
This mountain I climb, is dangerously high, but I'm not gonna fall fall fall fall
I'm swimming too far in the cold and dark, but I won't drown drown drown drown
These wings carry me over the seas so I can touch ground ground ground ground

Over the deserts, into the forest I run as a child to hide from my hunger
My biggest fear, I fight with my hands and my spear

Over the deserts, into the forest I run as a child to hide from my hunger
My biggest fear, I fight with my hands and my spear

I'm covered with flames, my skin is on fire but I won't burn
This mountain I climb, is dangerously high but I'm not gonna fall fall fall fall
I'm swimming too far in the cold and dark, but I won't drown drown drown drown
These wings carry me over the seas so I can touch ground ground ground ground

4x Over the deserts, into the forest I run as a child to hide from my hunger
My biggest fear, I fight with my hands and my spear
